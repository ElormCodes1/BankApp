this is a project i'm presenting for my second year first semester database class. 
the focus is on the database here so don't mind my shitty ui, i'll work on it later.
i'm using javafx for my ui because i'm taking java this semester and it'll help me practice.
for the database, i'm hosting it on mysql server and i'm using dbgate as my dbms. i'll update this later.
